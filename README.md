Ian Mann
Broke College Student

I am currently a Sophomore at the University of California Riverside in the Undeclared major. As a child I grew up in Philadelphia and attended a boarding school in Connecticut during my high school years. Pushing myself to get out of my comfort zone has always been a goal of mine and through traveling and learning I continually find myself in new and exciting situations. Going to college in California when I live in Philadelphia has pushed me to make new connections and meet new people I would never have met otherwise. Very similar to my boarding school experience I have spent a lot of time working on independence. During the summers I work at a YMCA overnight camp where I supervise campers and teach various skills to them. Before becoming a leader and counselor there, I was a camper there. Over many years I was able to develop different survival skills and participate in activities such as sailing and community service. Now as a counselor it is really rewarding to pass on those skills that I learned.

Travelling is another interest of mine that helps me step outside of my comfort zone. I travel out to California for college and vice versa back to Philadelphia for breaks. The summer before my freshman year of college, I went on a trip to Korea and Thailand where I was able to immerse myself in the culture of South Asia. Staying with friends from my boarding school I was able to save a lot of money for lodging and food while also having people to guide me around such unknown areas. There I met lots of locals and had the opportunity to taste authentic Asian food and participate in so many different activities unique to their locations. I am currently saving up to visit Vietnam in the future as well as many other locations in the future. As I travel, I look to broaden my horizons, meet new people and create a lasting mark in the places I go. 

As college goes on, I have devolved an interest in Photography and Video Editing. I bought my first camera and am currently working on a couple projects in between my schoolwork. Even though it is more of a hobby now, I would like to get better at it and spend more time working on these projects. I have spoken to many different social influencers and they have taught me different techniques in filming. Unlike Philadelphia I find a lot more people out here whose interests line up with mine and the sunset colors are spectacular every day. As a student at UCR I aim to continue looking and expanding as I make more and more of an impact wherever I go. Even though I have done a lot already I believe this is the only the beginning and after college endâ€™s I will have more places to go and see. I hope that everyone has a similar sense of adventure that I do and while they go on such adventures they learn, and they grow.
